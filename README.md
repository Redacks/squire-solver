# Squire Solver

A Python project using OpenCV to automate gameplay of the game "Squire" by mvolution (https://mvolution.itch.io/squire).

## Overview

This project was created as a learning exercise to explore the capabilities of OpenCV (cv2) for screen scanning, image recognition, and automation. The primary goal was to see if a game could be played automatically by analyzing the screen and simulating user input, including button clicking. Additionally, this project served as an experiment to assess how effectively a large language model (like Gemini) could assist in code development.

**Game:** Squire (https://mvolution.itch.io/squire) - A fun and engaging puzzle game developed by sulai under the name mvolution. Please check it out!

**Disclaimer:** Much of the code in this project was generated or assisted by a large language model (Gemini). While efforts have been made to ensure accuracy and functionality, the code is provided "as is" without any guarantees.

**Status:** Work in Progress (WIP) - This is a fun, personal project and is currently under development.

## Features

- Screen Scanning: Uses OpenCV to capture and analyze the game screen.
- Image Recognition: Identifies game elements (e.g., tiles, buttons) using template matching.
- Automated Gameplay: Simulates mouse clicks, including button clicking, to interact with the game.

**Important Notes:**

- This program is optimized for a specific screen resolution and window arrangement. It may not work correctly on other setups due to pixel accuracy dependencies.
- This is a work in progress, and the automation may not be perfect.
- The code is designed to work with the game window on the left side of the screen.
- The project is provided for educational purposes and personal use.
- Due to the inclusion of game assets (screenshots) within the code, licensing is complex. This project is intended for personal, non-commercial use.
